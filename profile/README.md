**AI-native practice management for mental health professionals.**

---

We believe therapists should spend their time on what matters most: their clients. Not paperwork.

Jate eliminates the administrative burden that steals hours from mental health professionals every week—so they can focus on delivering life-changing care.

### What We Build

- **AI-powered documentation** — Progress notes, treatment plans, and clinical summaries in minutes, not hours
- **Smart practice management** — Scheduling, billing, and client workflows designed for therapists
- **Privacy-first architecture** — HIPAA-compliant by default, with security that exceeds industry standards

### Our Values

**Therapist-First** — Every feature solves a real problem therapists face
**AI as Assistant** — Technology amplifies human care; it never replaces it
**Trust Above All** — Mental health data is sacred. We treat it that way.
